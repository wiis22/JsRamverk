# SSR Editor



#### Starter project for DV1677 JSRamverk

### Getting started
The first thing we had to do to get be able to start working on the project was to run ´npm install´ to install all dependencies. This made us able to run ´node app.mjs´ to launch the app locally and see the current state of the project. One problem we noticed was that the current state of the app created a new document to the database library each time you saved a document instead of updating the old one. Another thing was that the app was missing a way to create a new document. The function used to add a document to the database was already in place but was used incrrectly as it was used when a document was supposed to be saved. We createed a new function to update a document. On the bottom of the index page we added a form to create a new document.

### Choosing frontend framework
We went through different options of frontend frameworks and came to choose React. We choose React mainly because we want to learn it and we found the things we seen of it so far to be interesting and useful.
